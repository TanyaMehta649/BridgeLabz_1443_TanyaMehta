// Function Declaration
// A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. The function declaration must have a function name.
// Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they cannot be nested inside a functional block.
// These are executed before any other code.
// The function in the function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.
Syntax:
function geeksforGeeks(paramA, paramB) {
    // Set of statements
}
// Function Expression
// A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.
// Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.
let ans=geeksforGeeks(p1,p2);
