// A JavaScript execution context is a critical concept that defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. The execution context consists of two main components:

// Code Execution:
// This part involves the actual execution of the code line by line, interpreting and processing statements, and performing the actions specified in the script.
// Lexical Environment:
// The lexical environment includes the variables and their values that are accessible during the execution of the code.
